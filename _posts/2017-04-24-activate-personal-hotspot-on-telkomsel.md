title: Activate Personal Hotspot on Telkomsel
---

I did these steps below to activate personal hotspot on iPhone 7 on iOS 10.3.1. I use Telkomsel network.

1. Go to settings > Cellular > Cellular Data Options > Cellular Data Network.
2. On Cellular Data and Personal Hotspot section, write **internet** on the APN field.
3. You can see Personal Hotspot is back on Settings.
