How I actually talk to strangers. Seriously.

## NPDA

Nama, Puji, Dengarkan, Akui or in English: Name, Praise, Listen, Acknowledge.
This is a hack introduced by [Bezie Manggala](https://twitter.com/beziemanggala), a communication trainer from Bandung, West Java. Since most of the tech guy / girls are rather reluctant to talk to a new people outside the circle, I think this hack is interesting.

First and foremost, you need to be as relax as possible, don’t ever think you will hurt someone or making a mistake.
Just be confident, if you know you’re saying something inappropriate or out of context, just simply stop and apologise and get back to the talking.

## Nama (Name)

Call his/her name. If you want to be noticed by someone the first time you meet someone, ask his / her name politely and by shaking the person’s name, don’t show shyness, show your confidence, even if you’re not. Just relax :)

## Puji (Praise)

After you got the person’s name. Find a way to praise her. Anything will do, you can praise the name, the clothes, the look, the car. Some examples:
“Wow, you look great today with that suit!”
“Wow, that’s a lovely name. It remembers me about Princess Diana”
“You look awesome today!”

## Dengarkan (Listen)

Then you need to position yourself as a good listener, ask more about the person from a simple thing, slow but sure, don’t rush things and most importantly **don’t ever interrupt** the person talking to you. Show to the person that you care, even if you don’t. Listen first disagree later.

## Akui (Acknowledge)

Acknowledge the persons thought, before telling your opinion.

If he / she says “I feel that the director sucks big time”.
you says: “I see, that’s why the revenue is stalled”

If he / she says “I think this is the time to have a new car”.
you says: “I think you’re right your car is 10 years old already, but you need to be careful with the interest rate”
Then you can add some talks regarding the topics.
