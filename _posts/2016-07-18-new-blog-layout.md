Today I changed my blog layout to a basic Jekyll 3.0 theme.
It has basic list of posts that the reader can easily browse through.

It is inspired by Julia Evans' [blogpost](http://jvns.ca/) which has list of posts at her home
page, so that you can easily find post you find interesting. I intend to write about things I think great in subsequent posts and adding Disqus comment engine.

Thanks for reading. I'll see you soon.
